# Photo Finished: A Case for Bear
An old college ICT project (for the module "Client-side Customisation of Web Pages") in which I produced a small interactive murder-mystery adventure game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to run
Just open FrontPage.html in a browser (compatibility between browsers may vary - yay time constraints - but Firefox and Chrome seem to run things as intended). Read through that page to get an idea of the story and final goals of the game and then click the button to play.

### Notes
This was a college project, using the relatively limited knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript taught in that module, so please don't expect anything professional, by both computer science standards or fiction writing standards.
